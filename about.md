Hello! I'm Celina, and this is a page for a course I'm taking, called Open Source Software Development.

### About Celina:

* I'm a senior at NYU, studying Computer Science (and Psychology, just for fun).
* I'm half Turkish.
* I have a cat, and no one can agree on her name.

~~... Alas, I'm kind of terrible at writing 'about' sections ¯\_(ツ)_/¯~~
