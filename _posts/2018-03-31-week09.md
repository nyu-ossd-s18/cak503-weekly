## Questions for Danna Kelmer
1. How is being involved in open source projects in a corporate setting different from more individual involvement?
2. How did you become involved in open source at Google?
3. What kind of projects are you involved in?

## Group Project Progress:
- **Group progress:** My group has continued to open and find issues that we would like to work on individually, and we have begun making progress on contributing fixes. We haven't yet found one large issue that the 4 of us would like to collectively work on, so this will be one of our next steps.
- **Individual tasks:** I have commented on and recreated an issue and have a plan on how to proceed with working on it, which I expect to do by this weekend or early next week at the latest. Rosa and I are also looking into an issue together (and we've discussed it a bit on the jupyter slack channel for class), although we've had trouble recreating the issue so far.
