### The Cathedral and The Bazaar
*(Some notes on the essay on Open Source by Eric S. Raymond)* <br><br>

The cathedral and the bazaar were presented as two different models of development. In the cathedral model, the process of development is kept between a specific, closed group of developers; in contrast, the bazaar model opens development to the public, so it incorporates many "outside ideas" and code contributions.<br><br>

I think I would be more comfortable with the cathedral model, because it seems to be the more organized of the two, in that communication/organization would (presumably) be easier among a smaller, more involved community. With that being said, I can see the value in both models, and I'd be excited to be involved in both/either to see how I feel from real-world experience.<br><br>

Of the 19 lessons in the essay, the two I found most interesting were the following:
* "Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch." - I believe this means that useful solutions are born in response to real issues that developers might find and actually *want* to solve.

* "Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging." - i.e. listening to users' comments/concerns and allowing them access to source code and the development process makes the process much more efficient, because chances are, as users, they a) already have a personal interest in the product, so b) they'll be finding bugs or thinking about potential improvements, and c) have the chance to actually fix the problems they find (or at least discuss them), ultimately speeding the process of improving the program.
