### My First Contribution to Wikipedia: Grammarly
***How I selected Grammarly:*** I was searching through the articles that needed copy editing on Wikipedia and found it rather ironic that the article Grammarly was listed. As the name suggests, it's an app that corrects grammar, to put it simply. I noticed that there were a few grammatical errors, and I fixed three of them. All three were related to comma use (or, in this case, lack of use).

~~... I just want to take another moment to appreciate the irony of the situation, though. Okay, proceed.~~

***What my contribution was*** :
- Change 1 - added the comma in the following sentence: "The app is owned by Grammarly Inc., which develops AI-powered..."
- Change 2 - added the comma in the following sentence: "The Keyboard is an app for Android, which is integrated with..."
  - both Change 1 & 2 based on note 2 on [this](http://www.kentlaw.edu/academics/lrw/grinker/LwtaClauses__Restrictive_and_Nonrest.htm) page.
  - "When writing a nonrestrictive clause, do place a comma before 'which.'"

- Change 3: "In 2013, Grammarly was awarded the 'Gold Award'"
  (added comma after 2013)
  	- Based on Purdue Owl, rule 10 on [this](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/607/02/) page:
