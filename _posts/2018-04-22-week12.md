## Team Project Progress
We have completed our progress on the issues we were working on, and have begun working on our presentation.

**Individual**: The file size PR that Ashley and I were working on has been merged. The specific changes I worked on for this one were making filesize optional and only for notebooks/files (not directories), working toward changing filesize to readable format, making adjustments for efficiency ("get file size in base model" commit), etc.

Commits/discussion can be seen in [this PR](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/3539)
