## Danna Kelmer's Talk: Open Source at Google
I was surprised to find out how many projects used/built at Google were open source, many of which I hadn't heard of before. I think the approach of having internal/external versions makes sense, even though it can make contributions tricky for those outside of Google. I also think the approach with the Summer of Code seems like a great way to get students involved in both open source and working with these specific projects.

## Team Project Progress
As a team, we have continued to make progress on individual/pair contributions to Jupyter Notebook. We're currently searching for larger issues that we can work on as a team.
**Individual contributions:**
- Worked with Ashley on accessibility issues found by running [Pa11y](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y) (Ashley originally submitted this [issue](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3471) and made changes as well). Our changes can be seen in the Pull Request [here](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/3507).
- Rosa and I worked together on a fix for [this](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2337) issue re: cookies. We both discussed ideas and did research on how to approach the problem. I suggested using navigator.cookiesEnabled in this thread on [Slack](https://ossd-s18.slack.com/archives/C9G1QD9B2/p1522163949000814) - our solution is visible in [this PR](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/3511).

## Code of Conduct - Go
Projects would benefit from having a Code of Conduct, especially as detailed as the Go CoC.
- It establishes standards for behavior so that communication is productive and respectful.
- Makes it easier/welcoming for newcomers to know how to get started interacting with the community
The second goal is to provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.

**Jupyter Notebook** doesn't have a code of conduct for contributors.

### Contributions table updated.
