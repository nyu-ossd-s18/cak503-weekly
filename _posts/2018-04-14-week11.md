title: Week 11

## Progress on team projects since last week:
**Overall:** As a team, we have continued to make progress on individual/pair contributions to Jupyter Notebook; Rosa & Dana began working on a documentation issue, and a PR that Ashley created to was merged. The cookie issue that Rosa & I worked on is complete - our [PR was merged](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/3511). We have found a larger issue that we can work on as a team (the file size issue described below). Additionally, the accessibility PR that Ashley and I worked on needed a bit extra work, so to make it a team effort, Rosa & Dana will be making contributions to that as well.

**My contributions:** 
- Cookie Issue (Merged):
  - Fixed automatically stripped whitespace
  - Warning dialog needed adjustment - specifically, I removed the "OK" button as asked, since it served no real purpose
  - Added link on enabling cookies to dialog
  - [View PR](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/3511)
- File size Issue (in Progress):
  - Edited so that:
    - file size is an optional property
    - file size is only calculated for files and Notebooks, not directories
  - [View commits on branch](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/notebook/commits/filesize)
- Cache Issue (Merged):
  - Set "Cache-Control" header in respond_zip function as requested in PR comments
  - [View PR](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/3484)
