## Humanitarian:
I don't think the open source projects I'm familiar with could be classified as "humanitarian" in nature/purpose, but I do believe that, on a somewhat related note, some of them are conscious of the needs of their users. For example, I've come across much discussion on improving accessibility for Jupyter Notebook, just from looking through issues and pull requests.

## Progress on Group Project:
**Group Progress**
We met as a group on Tuesday to discuss our plan and get started. Together, we:
- Made sure everyone had the dev environment installed
- Looked through some of the open issues to make a list of what we might be able to contribute to
- Chose issues out of the list to start looking into / working on individually or with a partner

**Next Steps (Individual)**
My next steps will be the following:
- Become more familiar with the code (look through closed PRs)
- (Possibly) make a non-code contribution first, to become acquainted first-hand with the community
- Begin working on the [issue](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2337) Rosa & I chose
