## Open Data Week @ NYU
This event was hosted by BUGS on Monday night. It consisted of a 1-hour panel in which three panelists discussed how they defined Open Data, why it's important, and how it can be used / opened responsibly.

Afterward, attendees had the opportunity to look at & discuss the student project showcase, which featured several projects utilizing open data in some way, ranging from historical stock data to NYC restaurant health violations.

Below is a photo of me in the audience (shoutout to the student photobombing):

## Data Through Design (NY Media Center, Brooklyn)
I went to this event on Friday morning; it was an art exhibit, with work that was in some way based on NYC open datasets. For instance, one work, entitled *How We Die*, was a topographic piece representing leading causes of death in NYC between 2007 and 2013. Still other pieces were based on data like traffic fatalities, a tree census from 2015, etc.

Below is a photo of me at the exhibit.

Behind me is a work called *Broken Windows and Pink Tickets*, which used cords to represent certain low-level crimes (different colors for different violations), hanging over their corresponding geographic location in NYC.
