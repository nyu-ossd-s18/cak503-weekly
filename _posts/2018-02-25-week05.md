## What I'm looking for when I select an open source project to work on:
- Welcoming environment
- A few issues that are relatively easy for newcomers to jump into
- Good, well-organized readme, contributing instructions, etc.
- Topic that interests me

## What I'm able to offer to the team I'll be working on for the project / my strengths:
I'm confident that I'll be able to work on non-code contributions as well as certain code issues mainly in Java or JavaScript.

## What I'm hoping to learn from working on an open source project:
I'm hoping to learn firsthand what it's like to collaborate on a large project entirely(?) online, and to strengthen my coding and communication skills in the process.

## What I'm most worried about when thinking about / planning  to work on an open source project:
I'm worried I might not be able to make a significant or meaningful contribution, or that I might not choose a community that is suitable for / welcoming toward newcomers in open source, and that my experience won't be a positive one.

# Questions for Aurelia Moser

1. How did you first become involved in open source projects?
2. What advice would you give to people just getting into open source?

# My Contributions This Week:
I updated the Wikipedia page of a Turkish actress, Özge Özpirinçci, by adding her current TV role to her filmography/TV series table after I noticed it was missing. 

The contribution is visible [here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Celina725)
