## Summary of Team Assessment & Plan
My team chose to assess and plan to work on Jupyter Notebook, an open source project that allows users to create and share documents with live code, equations, etc. As a team, our strength is that we're all familiar/experienced with JavaScript, which is used in developing Jupyter Notebook. One of our team members is also familiar using the Notebook itself. One weakness is that the rest of us don't have prior experience with it, but we'll become familiar with it as a first step.

Our common meating time will be: 6:30pm on Tuesdays
Our alternative time: TBD
Milestones:
  - Comment on issues
  - Begin claiming / working on non-code issues (e.g. documentation)
  - Begin claiming / working on code issues
  - Review pull requests

## Open Data Week:
I'm planning on attending the Open Data @ NYU event on Monday, as well as the showcase at Hunter College on Wednesday.
