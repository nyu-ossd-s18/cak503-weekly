## Course Reflections

I enjoyed the course as a whole. I learned a lot about version control and working on open source projects, and I had a chance to make some contributions, which was exciting. If anything, I wish we had gone into a bit more detail on git.

Even though my team and I were lucky with finding Jupyter Notebook, I would add some more tips on finding good, beginner-friendly projects/communities, since that seemed to be something that affected a lot of teams. I also think adding more milestone(s) throughout the second half of the semester for contributing to our team projects might have been helpful.
